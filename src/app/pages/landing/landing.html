    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      At SmartHostel, we believe in transforming the traditional hostel experience into a
      modern, efficient, and user-friendly ecosystem. Founded with the vision of bridging
      the gap between students, hostel administrators, and staff, our platform brings
      everything you need — all in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Managing hostel tasks like room allocations, attendance, maintenance requests, and
      payments often becomes stressful for both students and management. SmartHostel was
      built to remove that friction. Our digital-first solution enables students to apply,
      check status, and make payments seamlessly from anywhere. Admins can manage room
      records, handle complaints, and track operations effortlessly using an intuitive
      dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes SmartHostel unique is our focus on automation, transparency, and
      simplicity. With features like real-time updates, secure data storage, and a clean
      responsive interface, our goal is to make hostel management not just easier, but
      smarter. We are continuously evolving — driven by student feedback, innovation, and
      a passion for excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re a student looking for convenience or an administrator aiming for
      better efficiency, SmartHostel is your go-to platform for a next-generation hostel
      experience. Join us on this journey to redefine comfort, trust, and technology in
      hostel living!
